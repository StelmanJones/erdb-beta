# ERDB
## Elden Ring Community tool coming soon™️ 

ERDB is a community database and in-game overlay for retrieving wiki information on items in Elden Ring. It is in early stages of development but is functional. You search for items in the overlay and the application fetches the data from a Meilisearch search engine server. 

 ## Features
> * View All stats for every item
> * Location
> * Description and more.



### Installation
Download the installer from releases and install it with the wizard!




## Usage:
> * Toggle the overlay with Ctrl + Shift + H
> * On startup the app will not show any windows but can be found in the system tray.



I made the application in Tauri with React and Mantine React Components. The data is stored in a Meilisearch search engine instance and fetched with the help of Meilisearch Instantsearch.

### Important!
As of now the overlay only works in borderless windowed mode.
